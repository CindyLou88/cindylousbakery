        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>Founded in 2024, Cindy Lou’s Bakery brings a taste of the South to your table with every bite. From our famous pecan pie to warm biscuits, we use only the freshest ingredients, ensuring that every dessert tastes as good as it looks.</p>
        <p>Our founder, Cindy Lou, grew up in a small Southern town where the kitchen was always full of laughter, delicious smells, and the love of good food. Now, she's bringing that same spirit to every cake, pie, and pastry she bakes here at Cindy Lou's Bakery. Our recipes are inspired by family traditions and local ingredients, blended with a modern twist to create something truly special.</p>
